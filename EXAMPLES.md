- "I want to add Mario's Italian Kitchen at 123 Oak Street to my lunch options"

### Getting Information
- "Show me all the restaurants I can choose from"
- "What restaurants do I have available for lunch?"

### Picking Restaurants
- "Pick a random restaurant for lunch"
- "Choose where I should eat today"
- "Surprise me with a lunch spot"

### Statistics
- "Show me which restaurants I visit most often"
- "What are my lunch statistics?"
- "Which places haven't I been to yet?"

## Integration with AI Assistants

The MCP server works seamlessly with AI assistants. You can have conversations like:

**You**: "I'm craving Mexican food today, what options do I have?"

**AI**: *Uses GetRestaurants tool, filters results*
"I found these Mexican restaurants in your list:
- Guelaguetza (Oaxacan Mexican) at 3014 W Olympic Blvd
- Gracias Madre (Vegan Mexican) at 8905 Melrose Ave

Would you like me to pick one randomly or would you prefer to choose?"

**You**: "Add a new sushi place called Yamashiro on Hollywood Boulevard"

**AI**: *Uses AddRestaurant tool*
"I've added Yamashiro (Japanese) at Hollywood Boulevard to your restaurant list!"

**You**: "I can't decide where to eat, pick something for me"

**AI**: *Uses PickRandomRestaurant tool*
"üçΩÔ∏è Time for lunch at Catch LA! It's a seafood restaurant at 8715 Melrose Ave. Enjoy your meal!"
